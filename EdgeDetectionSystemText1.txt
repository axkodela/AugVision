Project Name: A system to improve the vision of people with partial sight.

What is it?
	I would like to create a way for people with partial vision to be able to see better. There are multiple ways that I can go about this. I could use a cumputer created system to detect edges, detect differences in contrast between two overlapping objects, and also detect obstacles. By doing this, people with partial vision would be able to obtain better vision with the help of this device.

Why? to help the partially blind be able to see the outline of an object on a screen or on a projection unto the glass of the glasses frame.

How?:
	Step 1: Obtain materials - Small camera, Raspberry pi, Glasses Frame, Wires, Compter (for coding), etc.
	Step 2: Set up raspberry pi and the camera, then attach to the glasses frame.
	Step 3: Obtain image from camera.
	Step 4: send Image to Raspberry pi for editing and edge detection process.
	Step 5: send the new image back to display form (Screen, Projection, or otherwise.)
